# Construction_Project_Management_Report_Analysis

## Background 
Building construction projects generate huge amounts of data that can be leveraged to understand improvements in efficiency, cost savings, etc. There are several digital apps on the market that helps construction project managers keep track of the details of the process.  Analyze building construction projects using Python, perform statistical analyses, and present results in Tableau.

## Data Source
* Source data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/claytonmiller/construction-and-project-management-example-data).

This is a simple data set from a number of construction sites generated from project management field apps that are used for quality, safety a and site management.

Essential there are two files in this data set:
* Forms – generated from check list for quality/safety/site management
* Tasks – which is an action item typically used for quality snags/defects or safety issues.

### Acknowledgements
This data set was donated by Jason Rymer, a BIM Manager from Ireland who was keen to see more construction-related data online to be used to learn.
